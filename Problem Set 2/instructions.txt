Using keras, write seperate neural networks that:

-Classify the data shown in the MNIST data
-Classify the kind of clothing item (pant, shirt, etc.) shown in the Fashion MNISt dataset
-Classify the breast cancer measurements as benign of malignant

Notes:
Make sure to scale your data from 0 to 1 before using it (the labels are, but the other data isn't)
Each folder includes the original data, and my processing code (which contains the original data source)
Make sure you're using the processed data (single data and label pair of .csv files, with camelCase names)
If you can find a meaningful bug in the data processing code, some sort of extra credit will be awarded
Make sure you split the data into testing and training sets in your code
