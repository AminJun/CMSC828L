Using keras, write seperate neural networks that:

-Classify the data shown in the MNIST data
-Classify the kind of clothing item (pant, shirt, etc.) shown in the Fashion MNISt dataset
-Classify the breast cancer measurements as benign or malignant
-Do this using the best practices discussed in class (i.e. one hot encoding, ReLU, CNNS when you should, etc.)
-Have reasonable hyperparameters

You will submit:
A .py file and .pdf, or a jupyter notebook (/using the most recent version of jupyter/). 

Your things must include for each model:
-Training and testing accuracy vs epoch plots
-Some sort of reasonable print outs representative of the weight and biases (/not the entire things/)
-Examples of datapoints that fail in your models
-An explanation of why what you've included for all those things make sense
-An explanation of how/why your network's shape and layer choices, your loss function, and your activation function are correct
-Anything else you did that would convince us that you know what you're doing

Notes:
-Make sure to scale your data from 0 to 1 before using it (the labels are, but the other data isn't)
-Each folder includes the original data, and my processing code (which contains the original data source)
-Make sure you're using the processed data (single data and label pair of .csv files, with camelCase names)
-If you can find a meaningful bug in the data processing code, some sort of extra credit will be awarded
-Make sure you split the data into testing and training sets in your code
-You must use Python 3.5 or greater
-The code you give us should be a formality, everything should be laid out in the pdf or clearly explained in Jupyter notebook (in English and without a bunch of extra outputs)
-If you're on the fence about Python+pdf vs a jupyter notebook, please use Python+pdf (it's easier for us to grade)
-Please include seperate .pdf, .py, or jupyter files for each model
-Making submissions faster to grade is better for both of us (please don't be unnescesarily verbose)
  -6 total pages of pdfs (with /large/ figures, spacing, etc) is the absolute maximum you should be submitting (or the equivalent for jupyter notebooks)
-Please make sure that the write up isn't in broken or incoherent English (please don't do it after being awake for 30 hours straight, etc.)
-You're allowed to do some models in Jupyter and some in .py+.pdf, but please don't. Making things easier for the TAs is better for you to.
-The best way to get logistical/administrative questions about this assignment answered is to come to Justin's office hours (MW 5-6 in AVW 4101/4103)
-That's also the best way to get weird Linux problems answered (ask Chen about weird macOS problems)
